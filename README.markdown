media-tools
===========

A set of shell scripts for dealing with media, such as CD rips, DVD rips
and downloaded video.

Video is converted with quality settings suitable for playback on an Apple TV
or modern iPad.

Built and tested on macOS, might work on other Unix-like operating systems.

To use them:

 1. clone the repo
 2. `./script/bootstrap` to install dependencies
 3. `./script/test` to run the tests (optional, will download some video
    files from the internet)
 4. `make install`
